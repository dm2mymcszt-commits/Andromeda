# Round progress

Baseline: `300daf3` on `experiment/route-motion`. Full user request is preserved in `ROUND-PLAN.md`.

CI is the only native build host. Each implementation commit is pushed as a candidate so CI can build it; an item is marked done only after the build and its tests pass. Work stays in order. No Train or Plane modes.

| Item | Status | Verified implementation commit |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Remove Apps | done | `757f3fc` - CI 34581730357 passed; menu screenshot reviewed |
| 2. Remove Auto-Stop Timer | done | `5819554` - CI 34583153529 passed; screenshot reviewed |
| 3. Safe map taps and confirmation | done | `cdfb75c` + `b848fed` - CI 34609171515 passed; dark/light screenshots reviewed |
| 4. Favorites in every place picker | done | `57b343f` - CI 34610371414 passed; four picker screenshots reviewed |
| 5. Worldwide search, links, coordinates, plus codes, and sharing | in progress | - |
| 6. Simulation times and fastest-route ranking | not started | - |
| 7. Per-mode speeds, mode routes, and swap | not started | - |
| 8. Main-map route controls, seeking, and live speed | not started | - |
| 9. Finish actions and notifications | not started | - |
| 10. Persistent automatic/custom altitude | not started | - |

## Items 1-3 verified

Item 3: CI 34608469914 and final follow-up CI 34609171515 passed every check. Reviewed default/conditional Settings and running-route confirmation in dark and light simulator screenshots. Real double-tap-to-zoom interaction still needs the user's phone. Chosen details: 600 ms maximum address wait, five decimal places, pending proposals cancel when another tool opens.

## Item 4 verified

Favorites now appear above Recent Places in the shared picker, read from BookMarkRetrieve(), filter by name, and convert saved WGS-84 coordinates into map coordinates. The direct Favorites action uses the same conversion. Added real bookmark-storage and coordinate round-trip tests, with Start/Destination/Search and filtered screenshots. CI 34610371414 passed all checks. Start, Destination, Search, and accent-insensitive filtered Favorites screenshots were inspected.

Choices to record: preserve Favorites order; match names ignoring case and accents; use five-decimal coordinates below the name; unnamed legacy entries display Favorite; invalid saved coordinates are omitted.

## Item 5 in progress

Done: provider-policy research and read-only feasibility checks. Photon permits moderate search-as-you-type; Nominatim public autocomplete is prohibited, so use Photon. Original/expanded address probes find Talence, London, Berlin, Barcelona, Sao Paulo; Japanese block-format normalization finds Skytree. Actual production merged search must still pass all seven 50 m checks.

Left: generic provider layer, abbreviation/coordinate/DMS/plus-code/link parsing, paste integration, neutral Settings/About, offline and live tests, share extension with four actions and main-app handoff. No Google HTML scraping or paid keys.

Exact next step: implement generic search and parsers, test all seven addresses through the production engine, then implement and verify sharing. Do not advance to item 6 until item 5 meets the requested scope.
